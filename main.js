// TODO
//
//
// - data structure parsed content
// - CLI arguments parsing, something with process.ENV
//
//
// data format
// - adaptable for nested items
// - multiple blocks / sections
// - adaptable for other pieces of markup, maybe consist with the nodes
// structure of HTML how it includes bold/text nodes
// - ability to pull diffs, With a difficult object structure, it might be hard to
// compare nodes with nodejs, but I can use JSON.stringify and maybe find
// another library to compare them
// - convert to HTML. So it might be best to work with a format that is used by
// an HTML parser. And it will assure us that all features of HTML are
// supported, and that we can not have any unforeseen limitations to our data
// structure
